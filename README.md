# Gitignore Verifier Project

## Overview (Project's purpose)
The Gitignore Verifier is a powerful tool designed to enhance the visibility and management of file exclusion in projects using `.gitignore` rules. It traverses a specified directory structure, applies `.gitignore` rules, and generates detailed reports about the files it processes. This tool helps developers understand which files are ignored by `.gitignore` and why, making it invaluable for debugging and verifying `.gitignore` configurations.

## Features
- **File System Traversal**: Recursively walks through the file system starting from a specified root directory.
- **Rule Application**: Utilizes `.gitignore` rules to determine whether files should be ignored.
- **Detailed Reporting**: Provides comprehensive reports in both human-readable and machine-readable (JSON) formats, detailing which files are ignored or included and the specific `.gitignore` rules that affect them.
- **Conflict Detection**: Identifies and reports conflicts where multiple `.gitignore` rules might apply contradictorily to the same file.
- **Performance Metrics**: Captures and reports metrics such as total files processed, files included and excluded, execution time, and detected conflicts.

## Usage
To use the Gitignore Verifier, you need to provide paths to your `.gitignore` file and the directory you want to verify. The tool will then process the directory and generate reports that can be used to audit your `.gitignore` settings.

### Prerequisites
- Java 11 or higher
- Maven (for dependency management and building the project)

### Installation instructions
Clone the repository to your local machine and build the project using Maven:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nyuoss/project-gitignore.git
cd gitignore-verifier
```

### Building the Project
To build the project, navigate to the project directory where the `pom.xml` file is located and run:

  ```bash
  mvn clean install package
  ```
### Running the Tool (Usage instructions)
Compile and run the tool using the following commands:
   ```bash
  java -jar target/demo-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar <path_to_gitignore> <start_directory> <results_directory> <overwrite_flag>
  ```
Parameters:
  - <path_to_gitignore>: The path to the .gitignore file.
  - <start_directory>: The directory path where the file system traversal should start.
  - <results_directory>: The directory where the output files will be saved.
  - <overwrite_flag>: Boolean flag (true or false) indicating whether to overwrite existing files in the results directory.

  Example Commands:
  - Running with Overwrite Enabled
       ```bash
      java -jar target/demo-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar /Users/yourusername/projects/myproject/.gitignore /Users/yourusername/projects/myproject /Users/yourusername/projects/myproject/results true
      ```
