### Contributions

1. **Created the Java Template for the Project**
   - Developed the initial Java template (HW 1) that set the groundwork for further development, including the setup of the Maven build configuration.

2. **Implemented Main Functionalities**
   - **Gitignore Rules & Parser**: Designed and implemented the logic for parsing `.gitignore` files and applying the rules to file paths within the specified directory structure.
   - **File Walker**: Developed the file system walker that recursively traverses the directory tree, applying `.gitignore` rules to determine which files should be ignored based on the specified criteria.

3. **Testing**
   - Developed comprehensive JUnit tests for both the `.gitignore` rules logic and the parser component, ensuring that all functionalities meet the expected standards and behave correctly across various scenarios.

4. **Documentation**
   - Authored the `README.md` file, providing a detailed description of the project, its usage, features, and setup instructions, thereby facilitating ease of use and understanding for new contributors and users.
